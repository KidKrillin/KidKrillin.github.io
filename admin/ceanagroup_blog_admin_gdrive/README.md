# My Polished Site

Edit the HTML files and push to GitHub Pages.
- `index.html` is the home page.
- Extra pages live in `/pages`.
- Styles in `/assets/css/main.css`.
- Scripts in `/assets/js/main.js`.
- Images and logos in `/assets/img`.

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repository named `yourusername.github.io`.
2. Upload all files from this folder to the repository root.
3. In repo Settings > Pages, set Source to "Deploy from a branch" with the `main` branch and root folder.
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io`.
5. To use a custom domain, add it under Settings > Pages, then follow DNS instructions in the main guide.
